# Titanic Competition on Kaggle
This is a beginner friendly and interesting competition on [kaggle](hhttps://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

It is a classification problem where we have to correctly predict which passengers survived the infamous shipwreck.

I got to practise my skills on Exploratory Data Analsis, data preprocessing and training a Neural Network using PyTorch.
