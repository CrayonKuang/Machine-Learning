# Mohs Hardness Competition on Kaggle
* This is a beginner friendly and interesting competition on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/prediction-of-mohs-hardness-with-machine-learning).

* Hardness, or the quantitative value of resistance to permanent or plastic deformation, plays a very crucial role in materials design in many applications, such as ceramic coatings and abrasives.
Hardness testing is an especially useful method as it is non-destructive and simple to implement to gauge the plastic properties of a material. In this competition, we will be using regression techniques to
to predict hardness in naturally occurring materials, which integrates atomic and electronic features from composition directly across a wide variety of mineral compositions and crystal systems.

* I got to practise my skills on Exploratory Data Analsis, data engineering and training a RandomForestRegressor.
