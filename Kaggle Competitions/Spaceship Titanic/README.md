# Spaceship Titanic Competition on Kaggle
This is a beginner friendly and interesting competition on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

It is a classification problem where we have to correctly predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension.

I got to practise my skills on Exploratory Data Analsis, data engineering and training a XGBClassifier.
