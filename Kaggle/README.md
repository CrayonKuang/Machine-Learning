# Spaceship Titanic Competition on Kaggle
This is a beginner friendly and interesting competition on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

I got to practise my skills on Exploratory Data Analsis, data engineering and training a XGBClassifier.

I was glad that I attained a decent score of 0.80874 for the competition.
